# RoboCat Initial Informal Requirements

## 1. Client Information
* **Jim Zhu**
	* Email: zhuj@ohio.edu.
	* Office: Stocker 353.
* **Miguel Sempertegui Sosa**
	* Email: ms070613@ohio.edu.


## 2. Client Availability
* The client is available during both of our team meeting times (Mondays and Tuesdays at 6pm in ARC 108). However, we have not scheduled a set meeting time with them, but we will contact them and set up meeting times accordingly.
* RoboCat is located in **Stocker 302** and we have access to him mostly all of the time, we just need to get the key from Tiffany or email/text/call Dr. Zhu or Miguel to let us into the room.
* Dr. Zhu’s office is located in Stocker 353, and he prefers us to text him before we stop by and he will let us know if he is available then or when he will be available.

## 3. Initial Project Description from Client
A robotic cat that moves and behaves like a real cat.


## 4. Intended User Base
For now, just the University.

## 5. First Adopted User Group
The students at the student expo demonstration.

## 6. Detailed Feature List
* **Walking around** following someone (or something).
* **Continuous voice recognition** through the Adroid interface.
* **Cognition evolution**, the cat will look for food when he’s hungry in the form of a power source.
* **Log data from the accelerometer** as the cat walks around.
* **Facial recognition** to know when someone is sad, happy, a child, etc.
* **Environment mapping** so he can avoid running into walls, etc. and behave like a real cat.

## 7. Initial Use Cases
* We tell RoboCat to look for the color orange, and he sees someone in an orange shirt and follows him around until we tell him to stop.
* His battery is running low, so he looks around for a charging station (part of *cognition evolution*).
* Someone yells at him, "bad cat!," and he gets scared and runs away.
* Someone is nice to him, "I love you, cat, "and he gets happy and goes towards that person.

## 8. Information Non-Functional Requirements
* **Security requirement**: he is locked in room 302, we need a key to access. However, all of the code is public and completely open source.
* **Hardware-software compatibility requirement**: all of the hardware is already installed on the cat, and we need to code  (mostly in Android SDK) to access it. The client made it clear that it is not our responsibility to design the hardware, we are only responsible for using it intelligently.
