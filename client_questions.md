# Questions for Client at Initial Meeting

### Meeting was held Tuesday, September 6th at 6pm in ARC 106.

## Quintin Fettes
* Was an existing image processing package used for facial recognition, or was a custom package used? If so, which package?
* Is the algorithm used for facial recognition and positioning flexible? (Would you be willing to switch to a different algorithm if a better option exists or do you want to go forward with the existing one?)
* Which feature of the robocat is the most urgent for us to improve/implement?
* Which feature of the robocat is furthest from being complete? Which is the closest?
* What is meant by “add a range sensing mechanism?”

## Zach Taylor
* Not specifically project related, but what info is Dr. Zhu comfortable with us posting for our initial requirement doc on github.
* Name and availability for meetings, office hours, etc…
* For the target following requirement, what is the target? A color, bullseye, or does it go along with facial recognition and the face should be tracked/followed?

## Luke Shays
* Are EE/ME students going to be working on the robocat as well?
* What were the major issues faced by CS students from past projects?
* What specifically do the peripherals (arduino mega and polulo) control?

## Alex Vild
* What language(s) are the already functioning aspects of the cat written in?
* What are the hardware specs of the cat?
* What is being used as the power source (batteries, charging, etc)?

## Seattle Ruzek:
* What software should we download in order to program on our machines? (Arduino IDE, etc)
* Is it possible to use a VU meter to receive a voice command like “hey cat” to begin listening for a command instead of pushing a button? (This isn’t continuous and would require a purchase of a VU meter, if it’s possible.)
* The face track code is written in Java, but the camera uses C++, and there’s also MatLab code for the movement, which language would we be using to code primarily? Or all?
* Since there’s already MatLab code for the angles of the movement, what would need to happen to implement movement in the cat? (i.e what would send signals to the hardware in the legs, or is there hardware in place?)
* What type of Polulo controller is being used?
* One of the hardware requirements is “check battery status”. Besides the Android OS device, is there anything else that requires power? How would you want that battery status to be displayed (on the app, with another peripheral device on the cat, etc)?
* Another requirement is “log data from accelerometer”. Is there already an accelerometer in place? Where is the code for the accelerometer? How would you want that data logged?

## Kurtis Davis
* Can the GitHub repository be a public one or does Dr. Zhu want us to keep it private?
* Should we add Dr. Zhu and (grad student) to our GitHub repository?
* How much access are we going to have to the bobcat?
* Where is the color tracking code located?
