# RoboApp readme file from last year's project
## Team project for CS 4560

![alt tag](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/8169/badge.svg?flat=1)

The project, led by <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/engineering/about/people/profiles.cfm?profile=zhuj">Dr. Jim Zhu</a>, has the goal of creating a sentient robotic bobcat.
The end product will be a robotic bobcat which can navigate an environment based on sight.  The cat, called Robocat from here, will be able to find food, in the form of a charging station, as well as form affinities for people it is familiar with.  Robocat, beyond visual input, will also  accept audio input.  Robocat will be able to recognize and react to  its own name as well as several other phrases and the volume of the audio.

##Current State
RoboCat is able to respond to voice commands after the touch of a button.  it also currently has basic color recognition and facial detection provided through <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV.</a>

Also currently available in the app are activities which allow terminal contact with the pololu, for log purposes, and to manually send values to the servos (The servos are what allow the bobcat to maneuver through the environment).
