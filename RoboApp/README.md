#Build Instructions

This directory contains the main RoboCat app- the other android applications in this repository were deliberately created to be seperate modules in an effort to, obviously, modulate the code base a bit and allow for a more black-box design.

Building the app is simple- open this application in Android Studio, and build & run the project within Android Studio. No external dependencies need be installed, they should all be included in the repo and be compiled and built when the main application is run.

The majority of the code base takes place in the FdActivity.java file, located at RoboApp/RoboApp/app/src/main/java/com/robodoot
