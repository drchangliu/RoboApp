Github link is to a project that already implements color tracking in OpenCV for android.  If we stick with OpenCV it might be beneficial to scan through this code to get ideas for improvements.
Stackoverflow link it to a discussion about color detection in android without using openCV. This link might be helpful if we implement color tracking in something other than openCV.

Notes:
We decided that it would be best if we could dump openCV and move to all native android APIs for robocat development. Android already has a face detection API to work with, but I have not found anything related to color recognition.
